<div id="statement">
  <p>The year 2019. I have been working in the PCC deli for about 5 years. I am running the hot bar, deli counter, pizza, taqueria, washing dishes, making coffee, and packaging food. Often all on the same day. When I was schedualed for a "togo" shift, I brought up that I had never been trained on that particular shift. "You don't need to be trained on to-go's Wesley" my PIC told me.</p>
  <p>I was briefly shown how to look up black bottom combo's. I was told to pick a protein in the walk in and search it in the scale, and scroll through all the items that show up. If you search "Spicy Chicken Thighs" all sorts of combo's show up such as "Spicy Chicken Thighs with Asian Capellini". I took a sheet of paper, wrote down every salad and protein, searched through the system and made a graph linking every combo I could make. I did this one time ever.</p>
  <p>The very next day I wrote a simple script that would do this for me. I got the combo's off of cheftec and wrote a simple match maker with python. Initially I had this running on my phone, but I eventually built it into a web server and put the IP on the whiteboard. I showed it to my managers and co-workers, but nobody used it untill I bought a domain name, I went with thefremontdeli.com.</p>
  <p>Eventually other staff members started to use it. I have taken feedback from coworkers, a cook told me he would use it if I found a way to put the PLU codes up for each combo. I made it happen. At this point I have had traffic from PCC's I have never even been to, which I think is pretty cool. I find it is particularly helpful when a staff member is new, and hasn't had the years to farmiliarize themselves with every item in the system.</p>

  <p>There are a few limitations I have run into with this project. For example, I would love to have the site automatically update with every new black bottom as they get uploaded into the system. To make this happen I would have to re-write the app on the side of the internal network, which I would love the opportunity to do.</p>
  <p>When I show this to staff they often ask "Have you been paid for this?" and I respond, "No, in fact I am paying for it." The site currently costs approxomently 10 dollars per month, fluctuating based on usage. The cost would be 0 if it was written into the internal network, since there would be no need for a server.</p>
  <p>If I could get this message to the PCC IT team, I would love to work with you on this project. Please email me at wootenwesley@gmail.com if you're interested in helping me make this happen!</p>
