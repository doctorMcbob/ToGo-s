    <h3>Welcome!</h3> 
    This is a website I made to help make To-Go's at my work at the Fremont Pcc Deli,<br>though now I work at the Ballard location.
    <br>
    I have written a problem statement <a href="/why"> here </a>, if any of you want to pass it along up the chain, let them know you like the site!
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/famaze">Did you know I have a speedrun world record</a>
    
    <h3>How do I use this?</h3>
    Its easy! Click the <a href="/togo">TOGO</a> link, fill it out with everything you have, press submit, and you have your list!<br>
    No more looking through the scale to find what goes with what! No more memorizing!
    
    <h3>What if I have a problem with the website?</h3>
    You can easily contact me at wootenwesley@gmail.com<br>
    Or maybe you even have a cool idea for a way this webspace could help you in another shift?<br>
    Think about it.
