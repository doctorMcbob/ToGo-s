  <h3>Welcome!</h3> 
  This is a website I made to help make To-Go's at my work at the Fremont Pcc Deli,<br>though now I work at the Ballard location.
  <br>
  I have written a problem statement <a href="/why"> here </a>, if any of you want to pass it along up the chain, let them know you like the site!
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/famaze">Did you know I have a speedrun world record</a>
  
  <h3>How do I use this?</h3>
  Its easy! Click the <a href="/togo">TOGO</a> link, fill it out with everything you have, press submit, and you have your list!<br>
  No more looking through the scale to find what goes with what! No more memorizing!
  
  <h3>What if I have a problem with the website?</h3>
  You can easily contact me at wootenwesley@gmail.com<br>
  Or maybe you even have a cool idea for a way this webspace could help you in another shift?<br>
  Think about it.
